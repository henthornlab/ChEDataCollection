# ChEDataCollection
Flask app created by Eddie Barry (RHIT CHE class of 2022) and David Henthorn (RHIT CHE).

When running, allows users to query a website to select which data to download from a OSIsoft PI data archive.

Server must be running the PI SDK, which means this works only on Windows machines. Clients connect from any web browser that can accept a CSV file download.
